Other tech/concept was used is Locator for injection, Hive for Database, ViewModel for data distribution,
Locator for crashed preventor and avoid memeory leaks, custom text view, and EventBus.

## Future Improvement.

1. Will be using BLoC but same MVVM pattern.
2. Using FLOOR database in place of HIVE
3. Added release key for release build
4. Using APIs to store data in the server so it will be easy to access.
